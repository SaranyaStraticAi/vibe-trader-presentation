Our Moat: Why every trade makes us smarter 

Customer and trading data
Trading Data: we get predictive insights based on user intent by analyzing chats, trades, behavior, 
Customer Data: we can totally segment and target customers, their needs and habits based on similar signals
We will use that data to improve our marketing, sales, product, and partnership strategies
We will use that data to grow our DaaS business
We will use these insights to build additional technologies. 

Scale: FOREX as a starting point 

FOREX is a great starting point (9T vs. 80B NYSE)
FOREX is not as regulated
This Technology allows us to innovate in other ways (BTC, Options/Futures)


De-Risking the Opportunity 

To justify an internal valuation of $10M High-Pedigree/High-Efficiency model that significantly de-risks investor capital. Our valuation is anchored partly in our founding team (Ex-Amazon, Fortune 500 consulting, and seasoned SaaS growth leaders) which reduces our execution risk, combined with a high-margin $250/month ARPU target that triples standard SaaS unit economics. By utilizing a B2B2C distribution strategy through broker partnerships, we are positioning the company to capture a $7.5M ARR opportunity via our 2,500-user pilot program without the heavy customer acquisition costs (CAC) typically seen in fintech. This $1M raise provides a 12 month runway to displace the outdated MetaTrader incumbent, transitioning us from 200 organic beta users to a scalable, venture-grade enterprise with a clear path to an M&A exit with major financial institutions.
