## Slide 5: The Story / Insight Behind Vibe

**Thesis #1:** Better tools create better traders  
**Thesis #2:** Better traders create better broker economics

**The Problem We Experienced Firsthand:**
- Trading tools are fragmented, slow, generic
- Markets move faster than traders can interpret information
- Most traders don't understand why they win or lose
- AI exists, but isn't integrated into the trading workflow

**For Traders:** Real-time personalized insights, automated journaling & performance feedback, strategy creation/testing/deployment, access to proven strategies via marketplace

**For Brokers:** Higher retention, more active trading days, increased trading volume, stronger acquisition messaging

---

## Slide 6: Economic Outcome

**Why This Works for Brokers:**
- Traders trade longer and more consistently
- Brokers retain users and increase lifetime value
- Performance improvement becomes a marketing advantage
- Higher retention reduces acquisition pressure

**The Flywheel:**
1. Better tools → better traders
2. Better traders → better broker economics
3. Better economics → more broker distribution
4. More distribution → Vibe becomes embedded infrastructure

*"Brokers don't need more traders. They need traders who stay and trade."*

---

## Slide 7: AI Infrastructure for Trading

Vibe is an AI infrastructure layer that sits on top of trading activity—capturing data, improving decisions, and feeding a learning loop

1. **CAPTURE** — Data Aggregation & Journal
2. **IMPROVE** — AI insights, analysis, nudges, feedback
3. **EXECUTE** — Strategies, analysis, trades

---

## Slide 8: Growth Levers

1. **Broker partnerships** — Instant access to 20K–200K traders per broker; highest leverage, lowest marginal CAC
2. **Affiliate marketing** — Educators + communities; ~1,000+ signups per month

**Conservative assumptions:** 1,000 new users/month, 2 brokers per quarter, 5–10% conversion to paid

---

## Slide 16: Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Why they can't compete | Why we can |
|------------|----------------------|------------|
| Charting platforms (TradingView) | Adding AI breaks their feature-gated business model | Flat rate, no feature gatekeeping |
| Brokers (Oanda, Schwab) | Regulatory burden, would fall under financial advice | We are AI infrastructure, not a broker |
| Strategy Builder Companies (QuantConnect) | Old, developer-focused, no marketplace, expensive | Create strategies in English, one-click backtest |
| Strategy Marketplaces (MetaTrader, Collective2) | Cannot build strategies; requires developers | Create strategies by explaining in English or drawing on chart |

---
